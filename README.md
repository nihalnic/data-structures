### So you may ask me WTF is this data structures?

A data structure is a way to store data.

We structure data in different ways depending on what data we have, and what we want to do with it.

Family Tree

First, let's consider an example without computers in mind, just to get the idea.

If we want to store data about people we are related to, we use a family tree as the data structure. We choose a family tree as the data structure because we have information about people we are related to and how they are related, and we want an overview so that we can easily find a specific family member, several generations back.

With such a family tree data structure visually in front of you, it is easy to see, for example, who my mother's mother isâ€”it is 'Emma,' right? But without the links from child to parents that this data structure provides, it would be difficult to determine how the individuals are related.

Data structures give us the possibility to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services.

Data structures are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms. They help in managing and organizing data, reduce complexity, and increase efficiency

### What are Algorithms?

An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.

A cooking recipe written on a piece of paper is an example of an algorithm, where the goal is to make a certain dinner. The steps needed to make a specific dinner are described exactly.

When we talk about algorithms in Computer Science, the step-by-step instructions are written in a programming language, and instead of food ingredients, an algorithm uses data structures.

Algorithms are fundamental to computer programming as they provide step-by-step instructions for executing tasks. An efficient algorithm can help us to find the solution we are looking for, and to transform a slow program into a faster one.

By studying algorithms, developers can write better programs.

Algorithm examples:

Finding the fastest route in a GPS navigation system
Navigating an airplane or a car (cruise control)
Finding what users search for (search engine)
Sorting, for example sorting movies by rating
The algorithms we will look at in this tutorial are designed to solve specific problems, and are often made to work on specific data structures. For example, the 'Bubble Sort' algorithm is designed to sort values, and is made to work on arrays.
